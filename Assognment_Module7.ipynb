        "#### Ques 2:- Describe what a process pool is and how it helps in managing multiple processes efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:-** A process pool is a collection of worker processes that can execute tasks in parallel, helping to manage and distribute workloads across multiple CPU cores. It is part of concurrent programming and is commonly used when you need to perform CPU-bound tasks that benefit from parallelism, such as computations or data processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it works and helps manage multiple processes efficiently:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pool of Workers:** Instead of creating and managing multiple processes manually, a process pool pre-creates a fixed number of worker processes. These processes are then available to handle tasks as they come in, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying processes repeatedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Efficient Resource Management:** The pool size can be set based on the number of available CPU cores, ensuring that system resources are optimally used without overloading the machine. It helps balance the load and avoids excessive context switching or process creation costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task Distribution:** When new tasks are submitted, the process pool assigns them to an available worker. If all workers are busy, tasks are queued until a worker becomes available. This allows efficient handling of multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parallel Execution:** Since processes in the pool are separate from each other (each having its own memory space), they can run truly in parallel on multi-core systems. This makes process pools ideal for tasks that are heavy on CPU usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simplified Code:** Libraries like Python's multiprocessing.Pool make it easy to use process pools without worrying about the low-level details of process management, allowing developers to focus on the tasks themselves."

        "\n",
